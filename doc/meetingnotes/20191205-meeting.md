## Notes from Martijn
We're supposed to implement the functionality of inputting the nickname to the scoreboard according to the requirements.  
We can use the username, with which the user logs in to our game, and autofill the nickname field with this username.

If we decide to change some of the structure in our code, we <b>must update our diagrams</b>
