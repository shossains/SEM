- Layer design pattern is ok.
- Must haves all done
- To work on: collision fixing, switching to database server, sound effects
## Feedback on code from Martijn
Some feedback for Ass2,Ex3 (coding part):
- Redundant if conditions
- Comment more on database
- Query: make it a strategy pattern maybe (interface query)
- Fixed position in puck (magic number) -> pass screen dimensions to constructor maybe
- Think about rendering (separete rendering of game screen from specific instances like paddles and puck) -> could use command pattern
