## Done last week
Ben: Improving design patterns<br/>
Krzysztof: Scoring system little buggy, make a new board? ( + adjust the goals) <br/>
Shaan: Seperate db credentials (seperating it in a properties file is sufficient<br/> 
Matei: Working on diagrams -> button factory architecture <br/>
Ioana: Worked on design patterns of the gui -> seperate database and gui more properly <br/>

Layered architecture? -> Having a seperate layer for DB, GUI, ect. is sufficient<br/>
**The deadline of assignment 3 exercise is 3 will be extended, new deadline yet tbd**<br/>

## (Some) feedback assigment 2 exercise 3 aka previous sprint:
- NO AWS/Heroku server -> DB MUST BE HOSTED ON TUDELFT SERVERS
- Offline test should pass -> use mocks
- Remove chunks of commented block
- Try-Catch use a logger do it differently no print stacktrace
- Comments are improved
- Class query -> Make a strategy pattern, make a interface with default query and expand from there
- All rendering is now centralised, look into seperate rendering screen, input handeling, sound
    - Make sure to render the input handling first and then the screen
	- Command pattern is advised
	
##Upcoming sprint
Ben: Bug fix collisions <br/>
Krzysztof: Fix scoring system, make a new board and adjust the goals<br/>
Shaan: Put everything on a TUDelft server + write test which will pass offline <br/>
Add sound effects <br/>
