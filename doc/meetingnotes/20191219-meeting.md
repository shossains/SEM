## Done last week
Ioana: Code refactoring, worked with Matei at the button factory pattern to minimize code duplication.  
Ben: Finish testing for the game logic, improved the code coverage, fixed issues - added description.  
Matei: Worked on the ButtonFactory design pattern.    
Krzysztof: Looking into integration testing - libGDX testing.  
Shaan: Worked on testing the database.  

## Notes from Martijn
Improve formatting and naming: some methods are redundant, some statements are not used.
Use dependency injection and make the code more testable.
Some methods might be too long, for example Paddle: setSpeeds.
Good job with the inheritance use in the gamelogic package.
Improve code review: think about how you would have solved this issue and compare that with the actual implementation.
