### Notes on backlog/issues board
- Issues should be more precise on what wants to be achieved with that issue
  - If an issue is dependant on another issue make sure show that
  - Add weight to the issues to prioritize them (-> use `planinng poker`)

### Additional info
- PostgreSQL is fine. We need to be very `descriptive` -> be exact on how it is set up. And we have to make it work with the `CI` 
- We should `test` (at least several parts of) the `LibGDX`
- A `two-player-local-keyboard-interacted` Air Hockey game will suffice 
> The ultimate goal of the project is the development, rather than the game itself. "If you should choose between a big (hacky) game with a lot of features
> or a small compact stable game. The stable one is preferred"

### Planning for next week
- (Re-)Look at the requirements (Assignment 1)
- Make use cases and UML-diagram for 6 Must-haves (Assignment 2)
  - Interaction between user and paddles (Ben & Krzysztof)
  - Interaction between paddle and puck (Ben & Krzysztof)
  - Interaction between puck and board (Ben & Krzysztof)
  - MainMenu/StartButton (Matei)
  - Database/scores-storage logic (Shaan)
  - Authentication-logic (Ioana)
- Fix that the user can specify his/her own name on the scoreboard
